My cat is stuck in a tree! I need to get her down but how should I traverse the tree to find her? This project focuses on using binary trees.
A breadth first search is used to find where in the tree she is so that she canbe rescued.

This project was a collaborative effort between me, Ming Rui, and Miriam.
My contribution was animating the program using stddraw. Miriam worked on the search algorithm
and Ming Rui provided support in coding the different classes.
