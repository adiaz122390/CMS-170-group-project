This project focuses on manipulating binary trees. My cat is stuck in a tree.
A depth first search is used to find where in the tree she is so that she can
be rescued.

This project was a collaborative effort between me, Ming Rui, and Miriam.
My contribution was animating the program. Miriam worked on the search algorithm
and Ming Rui provided support in coding the different classes.
